        Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl, what is it?
      </h3>

      <p> 
        Mosaic viruses affect more than 150 types of plants, including many fruits, vegetables, and flowers. 
        The disease is characterized by leaves that are mottled with yellow, white, and light or dark green spots and streaks 
        (in other words, a “mosaic” of these colors). Some of the most commonly infected plants include tomatoes, squashes, cauliflower, and cucumbers, but many more plants are susceptible.

      <p> 
        Strategies to effectively manage the disease include:

        <h6> Before Planting </h6>
        <ul>
          <li> Select TYLCV-resistant varieties. </li>
          <li> Use virus- and whitefly-free transplants. </li>
          <li> DO NOT import tomato (or any potential whitefly host) transplants from areas known to have the virus (Florida, Georgia and Texas in the U.S.; and Mexico). </li>

        </ul>
            
      </p>
      <h6> During the Growing Season </h6>
      <p>
        <ul> 
          <li> Plant immediately after any tomato-free period or true winter season. </li>
          <li> Avoid planting new fields near older fields (especially those with TYLCV-infected plants).</li>
          <li> Manage whiteflies.</li>
          <li> Cover plants with floating row covers of fine mesh (Agryl or Agribon) to protect from whitefly infestations. </li>
          <li> Rogue diseased plants when incidence of virus infection is low. </li>
          <li> Practice good weed management in and around fields to the extent feasible. </li>
        </ul>
      </p> 
        
      <h6> After the Growing Season </h6>
      <p>
        <ul> 
          <li> Remove and destroy old crop residue and volunteers on a regional basis. </li>
          <li> A voluntary or enforced regional host-free period in areas lacking a true winter season 
            (i.e., temperatures low enough to prevent crop cultivation and whitefly survival) might be a useful management tool. 
            The crops to be included in a region will depend on the agroecosystem.</li>
        </ul>

          Symptoms & Signs
        </h3>
        <p> 
          Infected tomato plants initially show stunted and erect or upright plant growth; plants infected at an early stage of growth will show severe stunting. 
          However, the most diagnostic symptoms are those in leaves.

          Leaves of infected plants are small and curl upward; and show strong crumpling and interveinal and marginal yellowing. 
          The internodes of infected plants become shortened and, together with the stunted growth, plants often take on a bushy appearance, 
          which is sometimes referred to as 'bonsai' or broccoli'-like growth. Flowers formed on infected plants commonly do not develop and fall off (abscise). 
          Fruit production is dramatically reduced, particularly when plants are infected at an early age, and it is not uncommon for losses of 100% to be experienced in fields with heavily infected plants.
