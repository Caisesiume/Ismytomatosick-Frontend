Name
Tomato Diagnostics

Description
Tomato Diagnostics is meant to bridge the gap between the hobby-farmer and the experience that is out there. Instead of leaving the hobby-farmer to its own devices, Tomato Diagnostics helps to diagnose the tomato plant.
Tomato Diagnostics is an application that takes a user's own image of their own tomato plant and determines whether the plant is healthy or not. The application will be able to detect 10 common diseases among tomato plants.
Tomato Diagnostics is directly aimed to fill the need of the ordinary amature/home farmer that lacks the experience to, on their own, detect different illnesses among their tomato plants. All the user has to do to figure out what state their plant is in is to upload a picture of their plant's leaf to Tomato Diagnostics and the application will determine in what state the plant is in.
