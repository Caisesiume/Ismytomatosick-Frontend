            Leaf Mold, what is it?
          </h3>
  
          <p> 
            Leaf mold is caused by the fungus Passalora fulva (previously called Fulvia fulva or Cladosporium fulvum). 
            It is not known to be pathogenic on any plant other than tomato. There are many races of P. fulva.


            Spores of P. fulva can survive for 6 months to a year above ground at room temperature.
            Spores of P. fulva can start an infection at a wide range of temperatures.
            Relative humidity at or above 85% will favor severe leaf mold epidemics, but some disease can occur at humidity less than 85 %.
            New spores form on the lower surface of infected leaves within 10 to 12 days. If humidity remains over 85%, these spores will infect new leaves.
            Within the growing season, multiple generations of the pathogen can be completed.
            It can spread from leaf to leaf and plant to plant by wind, rain/overhead irrigation, tools, workers and perhaps insects.

          <p> 
          Because of the high humidity requirements of tomato leaf mold, this disease is unlikely to be seen in home gardens.
          Its hard to handle leaf mold when it has occured, best way is to prevent it by:%
          <ul> 
            <li> Use drip irrigation and avoid watering foliage. </li>
            <li> Space plants to provide good air movement between rows and individual plants.</li>
            <li> Stake, string or prune to increase airflow in and around the plant.</li>
            <li> Sterilize stakes, ties, trellises, etc. with 10% household bleach or commercial sanitizer.</li>
            <li> Circulate air in greenhouses or tunnels with vents and fans and by rolling up high tunnel sides to reduce humidity around plants. </li>
            <li> Keep night temperatures in greenhouses higher than outside temperatures to avoid dew formation on the foliage. </li>
            <li> Remove crop residue at the end of the season. Burn it or bury it away from tomato production areas. </li>
            <li> Clean the high tunnel or greenhouse walls and benches at the end of the season with a commercial sanitizer. </li>
          </ul>

              Symptoms & Signs
            </h3>
            <p> 
              How you tell if your tomato plants are suffering from leaf mold:
              <ul> 
                <li> The oldest leaves are infected first. </li>
                <li> Pale greenish-yellow spots, usually less than 1/4 inch, with no definite margins, form on the upper sides of leaves.</li>
                <li> Olive-green to brown velvety mold forms on the lower leaf surface below leaf spots.</li>
                <li> Leaf spots grow together and turn brown. Leaves wither and die but often remain attached to the plant.</li>
                <li> Infected blossoms turn black and fall off. </li>
                <li> Fruit infections start as a smooth black irregular area on the stem end of the fruit. As the disease progresses, the infected area becomes sunken, dry and leathery. </li>
              </ul>
